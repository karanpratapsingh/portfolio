Greetings React Native Community, today I'll be helping you setup Microsoft's Codepush into your app. So that you can do seamless releases.

#### What is CodePush?

CodePush a technology that helps in the delivery of app updates and improvements to the end users instantly.

This is especially great if you want to do critical bug fixes and deliver instantly without going through the app store reviews.

You can think of it as "web-like" agility of side-loading updates as soon as they are available.

Moreover, it provides rollbacks if the new update crashed the app

![codepush-about](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29705703/81784598-b9f8cc80-951a-11ea-8609-233306ccb522.png)

#### How does it work?

CodePush keeps your app's javascript bundle in sync with the CodePush server, and every time the user opens the app it checks with the CodePush server if a new update is available to the bundle. And of course, it comes with tons of awesome configuration which can help us fine-tune our user's experience.

I personally use CodePush in almost all the React Native projects I work with as it is a very promising technology.

You can read more about it [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push#how-does-it-work)

#### Let's get started :rocket:

Let's get started by first creating standard deployments for CodePush in AppCenter.

<i>
  I'll be assuming that you already know how to log in with AppCenter and create
  or link a new Android/iOS app, if you don't then please check out
  adding/linking part of this guide
  [here](https://karanpratapsingh.com/blog/continuous-integration-appcenter-react-native)
</i>

- Navigate to `Codepush` under `Distribute` and click on `Create Standard Deployment`

![navigate-deployment](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29705703/81784621-c41acb00-951a-11ea-998a-54983c0a0f5b.png)

- Now, to the top right you should be able to select your environment

![available-environments](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29705703/81784511-97ff4a00-951a-11ea-8225-52bc29e36691.png)

- Click on the settings items at the top right and keys panel should open reveling your keys (we'll be needing them later)

![check-keys](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29705703/81784562-ac434700-951a-11ea-9522-5cf16a287a40.png)

### Integration

With the keys now available, let's integrate CodePush into our apps. For this we'll need to install [react-native-code-push](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push)

```
yarn add react-native-code-push
```

Or if you prefer npm then,

```
npm i --save react-native-code-push
```

#### Android

In this section, we'll see how to integrate CodePush plugin with our native android project.

- In your `android/settings.gradle`, add the following:

```gradle
include ':app', ':react-native-code-push'
project(':react-native-code-push').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-code-push/android/app')
```

- In your `android/app/build.gradle`, add the `codepush.gradle` file as an additional build task definition underneath `react.gradle`

```gradle
...
apply from: "../../node_modules/react-native/react.gradle"
apply from: "../../node_modules/react-native-code-push/android/codepush.gradle"
...
```

- Update the `MainApplication.java` file to use CodePush via the following changes:

```java
...
// 1. Import the plugin class.
import com.microsoft.codepush.react.CodePush;

public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {

    private final ReactNativeHost mReactNativeHost = new ReactNativeHost(this) {
        ...

        // 2. Override the getJSBundleFile method in order to let
        // the CodePush runtime determine where to get the JS
        // bundle location from on each app start
        @Override
        protected String getJSBundleFile() {
            return CodePush.getJSBundleFile();
        }
    };
}
```

- Optional: You can add key in `android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` file like this or You can also skip adding deployment key here as you can dynamically override it via js (isn't that amazing 🤩), which we'll get to soon.

```xml
  <resources>
     <string name="app_name">AppName</string>
     <string moduleConfig="true" name="CodePushDeploymentKey">DeploymentKey</string>
  </resources>
```

{' '}

  Note: you can checkout the official CodePush android docs
  [here](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-code-push/blob/master/docs/setup-android.md)
  for more in depth look.
</i>
#### iOS

In this section, we'll see how to integrate CodePush plugin with our native iOS project.

- Run `cd ios && pod install && cd ..` to install all the necessary CocoaPods dependencies.
  ​
- Open up the `ios/<Your-Project>/AppDelegate.m` file, and add an import statement for the CodePush headers:

  ```objective-c
  #import <CodePush/CodePush.h>
  ```

- Find the following line of code, which sets the source URL for bridge for production releases:

  ```objective-c
  return [[NSBundle mainBundle] URLForResource:@"main" withExtension:@"jsbundle"];
  ```

  And Replace it with this line:

  ```objective-c
  return [CodePush bundleURL];
  ```

- Optional: Go to `ios/<Your-Project>/Info.plist` and add a new key as `CodePushDeploymentKey` of type `string` and add your iOS key.

```xml
<key>CodePushDeploymentKey</key>
<string>DeploymentKey</string>
```

<i>
  Note: you can checkout the official CodePush ios docs
  [here](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-code-push/blob/master/docs/setup-ios.md)
  for more in depth look.
</i>

#### Initialization

In this section we'll be following a simple example for initializing our CodePush plugin as there's no way I can do justice to all the options and configuration available in this plugin, so make sure to checkout the official CodePush js api reference [here](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-code-push/blob/master/docs/api-js.md)

```js
import codePush from 'react-native-code-push';

...

const codePushOptions = {
  installMode: codePush.InstallMode.IMMEDIATE,
  deploymentKey: "<YOUR KEY HERE>",
  checkFrequency: codePush.CheckFrequency.ON_APP_START,
};

export default codePush(codePushOptions)(App);
```

As always, Make sure to clean, rebuild, and reset your cache before running the app.

```bash
rm -rf ios/build android/app/build
```

```bash
yarn start -c

# or if you use npm

npm start --reset-cache
```

### Deployments

As our app is now ready to use CodePush, let's now look into how we'll be releasing updates. For this we'll need [appcenter-cli](https://github.com/microsoft/appcenter-cli)

```bash
yarn global add appcenter-cli
```

Or if you prefer npm then,

```bash
npm i -g appcenter-cli
```

<i>
  Note: You can also use `npx` if you don't like installing a lot of packages
  globally
</i>

- Now, we have to login with the cli. We can do that simply using the command below and authenticating with our AppCenter account.

```bash
appcenter login
```

- That's it, we're almost there. We can use the command below to make releases.

```
appcenter codepush release-react -a <user>/<app> -d <environment>
```

For Example:

```bash
appcenter codepush release-react -a Karan-Pratap-Singh/CodePushDemo -d Staging
```

<i>
  Note: To find out which apps are currently available to use in the `-a`
  argument then just use `appcenter apps list` command (you need to be
  authenticated)
</i>

- Bonus Tip :fire:

Typing these might get tedious, so what I like to do is add these scripts to my package.json like:

```json
"scripts": {
  "codepush:ios": "appcenter codepush release-react -a Karan-Pratap-Singh/CodePushDemo -d Staging",
  "codepush:android": "appcenter codepush release-react -a Karan-Pratap-Singh/CodePushDemo-Android -d Staging"
}
```

- After making the release it should be visible on your dashboard with tons of cool info about no. of installs, rollbacks etc.

![after-release-activity](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29705703/81784462-86b63d80-951a-11ea-8e7d-dd732a5234b5.png)

Well, this was all about setting up Codepush with App Center. However App Center has tons of great features like CI/CD, Analytics, Test Runs, Diagnostics, Push Notification, Crash Reporting.

If you're interested in CI/CD with AppCenter, checkout my other [article](https://karanpratapsingh.com/blog/continuous-integration-appcenter-react-native) about it.

Hopefully, you were able to integrate CodePush into your build and enjoy seamless updates :smile:
