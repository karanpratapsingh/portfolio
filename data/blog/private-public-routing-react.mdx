In this article, we'll be implementing private, public, and restricted routes. I'll be using [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start), but the idea should be similar across other routing libraries.

Let's take an example of the following components:

<b>Home</b>: or a similar public route that everyone can access.

<b>Login</b>: is a restricted route, which means it should only be accessible by
unauthenticated users because it doesn't make much sense if an authenticated
user can access login/signup pages.

<b>Dashboard</b>: is a private route that should only be accessed by
authenticated users.

Let's consider the following abstractions before we start with the code:

`isAuthenticated` which tells us if the user is authenticated or not.

`ROUTES` can be an enum to access our routes.

```ts
enum ROUTES {
  HOME = '/',
  LOGIN = '/login'
  DASHBOARD = '/dashboard'
}
```

### Private Route

The idea here is to render our component if the user is authenticated or redirect the user to login if not authenticated.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Route, Redirect, RouteProps } from 'react-router-dom';
import { ROUTES } from '../constants';
import { isAuthenticated } from '../auth.utils';

function PrivateRoute(props: RouteProps): React.ReactElement {
  const { component: Component, ...rest } = props;

  const render = props => {
    if (!isAuthenticated) {
      return <Redirect to={ROUTES.LOGIN} />;
    }

    return <Component {...props} />;
  };

  return <Route {...rest} render={render} />;
}

export default PrivateRoute;
```

### Public and Restricted Routes

The `Route` component from `react-router` is public by default but we can build upon it to make it restricted.

We can add a `restricted` prop with a default value of `false` and use the condition if the user is authenticated and the route is restricted, then we redirect the user back to the `Dashboard` component.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Route, Redirect, RouteProps } from 'react-router-dom';
import { ROUTES } from '../constants';
import { isAuthenticated } from '../auth.utils';

interface PublicRouteProps {
  restricted?: boolean;
}

function PublicRoute(props: PublicRouteProps & RouteProps): React.ReactElement {
  const { component: Component, restricted = false, ...rest } = props;

  const render = props => {
    if (isAuthenticated && restricted) {
      return <Redirect to={ROUTES.DASHBOARD} />;
    }

    return <Component {...props} />;
  };

  return <Route {...rest} render={render} />;
}

export default PublicRoute;
```

### Putting it together

Finally, let's declare all the routes in our `App.tsx` component and see how our routing looks now.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import { ROUTES } from './constants';
import { Home, Dashboard, Login } from './pages';
import { PrivateRoute, PublicRoute } from './components';

function App(): React.ReactElement {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Switch>
        <PublicRoute component={Home} path={ROUTES.HOME} exact />
        <PublicRoute restricted component={Login} path={ROUTES.LOGIN} exact />
        <PrivateRoute component={Dashboard} path={ROUTES.DASHBOARD} exact />
      </Switch>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Hopefully, this gave you an insight into how we can organize private and protected routes.
