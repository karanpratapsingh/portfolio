Recently I tried [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and I was blown away by how fast it was. I re-checked if I started the app correctly because I couldn't belive that it started the dev server under `200ms`!

So, here's a short article on what is Vite and how can we create a new react project with it.

## What is Vite?

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is build tool created by Evan You (creator of [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)), it provides faster developement experience with instant server start, super fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and out of the box support for TypeScript as well.

Vite pre-bundles dependencies using esbuild. Esbuild is written in Go and pre-bundles dependencies 10-100x faster than other JavaScript-based bundlers.

## Create a new project

Let's create a new project with Vite

```
yarn create vite
```

![vite select framework](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jppg9dtz2xdio63fekwl.png)

![template select](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/lk75zsr0bx1949wqotq9.png)

![vite done](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3bg4cv1egwt85cqzh60f.png)

And we have our vite project 🎉!

```

Let's start our dev server

```
cd vite-project
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Build

Vite uses [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) to build and optimize static assets. Let's build our project

```
yarn build
```

We have our static assets ready to be served!
