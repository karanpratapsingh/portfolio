In this article let's discuss how we can write simple unit tests in go.

All the code from this article is available on [github](https://github.com/karanpratapsingh/tutorials)

## Writing our first unit test

Initialize a `sample` module

```
go mod init sample
```

Let's start with adding a `length.go` file with a `Length` function. This function simply returns the length of the input string.

In go, tests file are usually named with `_test` (just like we do `.test.js` for jest). Let's create `length_test.go`.

This is a very basic test function in which we'll be testing out our `Length` function

Let's add some test logic

Let's run it!

```
go test
```

Yay! our test passed!

```bash
PASS
ok      sample  0.429s
```

Now let's change our `expected` variable to `5`, and re-run our test and we should see the test fail

```bash
--- FAIL: Test (0.00s)
    length_test.go:10: Expected 5 Got 4
FAIL
exit status 1
FAIL    sample  0.334s
```

### Multiple test cases

Let's add out test cases with `input` and `expected` outputs

_This approach is similar to [`test.each`](https://jestjs.io/docs/api#testeachtablename-fn-timeout) from jest_

Update `Test_Length` function to use `testCases`

Run the test cases!

```bash
PASS
ok      sample  0.347s
```
