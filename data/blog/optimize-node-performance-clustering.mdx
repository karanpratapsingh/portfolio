In this article, We will see how we can optimize our Node.js applications with clustering. Later we'll also do some benchmarks!

### What is clustering?

Node.js is single threaded by default and hence only utilizes one cpu core for that thread. So, to take advantage of all the cores available we need to launch a cluster of Node.js processes.

For this we can use the native [cluster](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html) module which creates several child processes (workers) that operate parallelly. Each generated process has it's own event loop, V8 instance and memory. The primary process and worker process communicate with each other via IPC (Inter-Process Communication).

_Note: Code from this tutorial will be available in this [repository](https://github.com/karanpratapsingh/tutorials/tree/master/node/cluster)_

### Project Setup

Let's initialize and setup our project!

```
$ yarn init -y
$ yarn add express typescript ts-node
$ yarn add -D @types/node @types/express
$ yarn tsc --init
```

Project directory should look like this

```
├── src
│   ├── cluster.ts
│   ├── default.ts
│   └── server.ts
├── tsconfig.json
├── package.json
└── yarn.lock
```

**server.ts**
Here, we'll bootstrap our simple [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) server

```ts
import express, { Request, Response } from 'express';

export function start(): void {
  const app = express();

  app.get('/api/intense', (req: Request, res: Response): void => {
    console.time('intense');
    intenseWork();
    console.timeEnd('intense');
    res.send('Done!');
  });

  app.listen(4000, () => {
    console.log(`Server started with worker ${process.pid}`);
  });
}

/**
 * Mimics some intense server-side work
 */
function intenseWork(): void {
  const list = new Array<number>(1e7);

  for (let i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
    list[i] = i * 12;
  }
}
```

**default.ts**

```ts
import * as Server from './server';

Server.start();
```

Start! Start! Start!

```
$ yarn ts-node src/default.ts

Server started with worker 22030
```

**cluster.ts**

Now let's use the [cluster](https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html) module

```ts
import cluster, { Worker } from 'cluster';
import os from 'os';
import * as Server from './server';

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  const cores = os.cpus().length;

  console.log(`Total cores: ${cores}`);
  console.log(`Primary process ${process.pid} is running`);

  for (let i = 0; i < cores; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }

  cluster.on('exit', (worker: Worker, code) => {
    console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} exited with code ${code}`);
    console.log('Fork new worker!');
    cluster.fork();
  });
} else {
  Server.start();
}
```

Start! Start! Start!

```
$ yarn ts-node src/cluster.ts

Total cores: 12
Primary process 22140 is running
Server started with worker 22146
Server started with worker 22150
Server started with worker 22143
Server started with worker 22147
Server started with worker 22153
Server started with worker 22148
Server started with worker 22144
Server started with worker 22145
Server started with worker 22149
Server started with worker 22154
Server started with worker 22152
Server started with worker 22151
```

### Benchmarking

For benchmarking, I will use [apache bench](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html). We can also use [loadtest](https://github.com/alexfernandez/loadtest) which has similar functionality.

```
$ ab -n 1000 -c 100 http://localhost:4000/api/intense

Here:

-n requests
-c concurrency
```

**Without Clustering**

### Conclusion

We can see a great reduction in our request time as incoming load is divided between all the worker processes.

If you don't want to use native cluster module, you can also try [PM2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2) which is a process manager with built in load balancer.
