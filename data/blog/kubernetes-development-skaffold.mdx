In this article, we'll see how we can use skaffold to develop our kubernetes native applications locally.

I will be using [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) for local kubernetes cluster

### What is Skaffold?

Skaffold is a command line tool that helps with development for Kubernetes-native applications by deploying to your local or remote Kubernetes cluster as you develop.

It can handle the workflow for building, pushing, and deploying your application. Skaffold also operates completely on the client-side, with no required components on your cluster, making it super lightweight and high-performance.

It has a great developer experience, and I've been using it for a while. Learn more about Skaffold [here](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/kubernetes-development-simplified-skaffold-is-now-ga)

### Install Skaffold

You can install scaffold from [here](https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/)

### Project setup

I've initialized a pretty simple express app.

```
├── src
│   └── index.js
├── package.json
└── yarn.lock
```

Start the minikube cluster

```
$ minikube start
```

### Dockerfile

Let's dockerize our app so that we can run it in our kubernetes cluster

_Note: To learn more about best practices for dockerizing your applications, checkout my [dockerize series](https://karanpratapsingh.com/blog/introduction-dockerize-series)!_

```dockerfile
FROM node:14-alpine
# Declare a workdir
WORKDIR /app
# Cache and install dependencies
COPY package.json yarn.lock ./
RUN yarn install
# Copy app files
COPY . ./
# Expose port
EXPOSE 4000
CMD [ "yarn", "start" ]
```

Also, let's quickly add a `.dockerignore` to exclude our `node_modules`

```
**/node_modules
```

### Creating K8s deployment

Let's create a `k8s` folder and create a `deployment.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app
  labels:
    app: app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: app
          image: node-app
          resources:
            limits:
              memory: 512Mi
              cpu: '1'
          ports:
            - containerPort: 4000
```

### Exposing k8s deployment with a service

Now, let's add a `k8s/service.yaml` of type `NodePort` to expose our deployment

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: app-svc
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: app
  ports:
    - port: 4000
      targetPort: 4000
```

### Scaffold config

And finally, we need to add a `skaffold.yaml` config for our app.

_Full config options can be found [here](https://skaffold.dev/docs/references/yaml/?version=v2beta18)_

```yaml
apiVersion: skaffold/v2beta18
kind: Config

profiles:
  - name: dev
    activation:
      - command: dev
    build:
      artifacts:
        - image: node-app
          context: .
          sync:
            manual:
              - src: 'src/**/*.js'
                dest: .
```

If you're storing your kubernetes yaml files in a custom path you can use this to `skaffold.yaml`

```yaml
profile: ...
deploy:
  kubectl:
    manifests:
      - custom/path/file.yaml
```

Start! Start! Start!

```
skaffold dev --port-forward
```

![skaffold-dev-output](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6qw37gvzxiph5ziwk05w.png)

_Note: We can also declare [`portForward`](https://skaffold.dev/docs/pipeline-stages/port-forwarding/) config in your `skaffold.yaml`_

```yaml
portForward:
  - resourceType: service
    resourceName: app-svc
    port: 4000
    localPort: 4000
```

### Using Buildpacks

Buildpacks enable building a container image from source code without the need for a `Dockerfile`.

Skaffold supports building with Cloud Native Buildpacks. This would help us simplify our `skaffold.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: skaffold/v2beta18
kind: Config

profiles:
  - name: dev
    activation:
      - command: dev
    build:
      artifacts:
        - image: node-app
          buildpacks:
            builder: 'gcr.io/buildpacks/builder:v1'
```

This article only scratches the surface of what skaffold is capable of! You can find tons examples in the official [github repository](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/skaffold)

I hope this was helpful, you can find all the code in this [repository](https://github.com/karanpratapsingh/tutorials/tree/master/kubernetes/skaffold). As always, feel free to reach out anytime if you face any issues.
