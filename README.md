## PORTFOLIO for 2020

Deployed at: [karanpratapsingh.com](https://karanpratapsingh.com)

### Make it your own:

- It's a standard [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) project using [expo-cli](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/)

- Everything is configurable via `IConfig` and `IProject` interfaces in `src/config/...`, so feel free fork and override them

- One click deploy on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

- Have fun 🎉
